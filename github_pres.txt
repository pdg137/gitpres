Data GitHub stores beyond Git

- Accounts
- Repository lists

Philosophical digression

- Is it a good idea to trust a central server that you don't control with all this data?
- Why doesn't git do these things? ESPECIALLY pull requests.

Fancy features that USE Git:

- Gists
- Wiki
- GitHub pages

Web features that enhance the experience:

- Contribution graphs, lists
- Link to lines of code
- Downloads
- Syntax highlighting
- Markdown / Textile formatting
- Image diffing

GitHub API

- Git doesn't have an API!!!!!
- This is great.
