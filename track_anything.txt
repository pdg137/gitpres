Multiple branches
- put some code on a branch
- check changes on a branch
	common = "!sh -c 'for i in `git show-branch --merge-base $@`; do git log -1 $i; done'"
    git log A --not B
	gitk A --not B
	--oneline --graph
	
Remote branches
- the word "remote" means a lot of things in git
- a "remote" can be any other repository that you can access
- look at the config file
- push a branch to a server
- make another change to the branch
  - important point - there are three different versions of the branch!
