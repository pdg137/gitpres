The goal of revision control:
  Track all steps in development.
  Facilitate collaboration between multiple developers and development efforts.

Revision control concepts
- revisions & commits
- diffs
- branches
- 3-way diffs
- conflicts

Traditional version control (RCS/CVS/Subversion)
  Central repository for tracking changes.
  Multiple developers make changes and "commit" to repository.

Distributed version control (Git/Mercurial)
  Each developer commits changes to private repositories.
  Developers "push" and "pull" changes to and from repositories as needed.
